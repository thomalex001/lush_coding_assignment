# Lush Coding Assignment - Simple Task List API

## Objective
Build a basic GraphQL API server using NodeJS, TypeScript, Apollo Server, Prisma, and Pothos GraphQL to manage a simple list of tasks. This assignment aims to evaluate your understanding of GraphQL principles, schema design with Pothos, TypeScript usage, and general backend development practices.

## Getting Started/Code Installation
Clone repository onto your machine and follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are using the correct NodeJS (22.12.0) version:
- If you already have NVM installed, simply run the command `nvm use` in your CLI at the root level  which will switch to the correct NodeJS version.
- If you do not have NVM installed, run the command `nvm install`. This will also install the NodeJS 22.12.0 version.
- You can check your current version using ` node -v` command.
2. In CLI run `npm i` on the root level to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to allow interacting with the database.
4. Then run `npm run dev` which will run the `server.ts` file.
5. Once server is "ready", follow the link at http://localhost:4000/.
6. On your browser, you will be able to make GraphQL queries (add/delete/toggle tasks etc..) to the database.

* Apollo Server
* Git/GitHub
* Pothos (GraphQL Schema Builder)
* Prisma

## My Initial Setup 
Created Git Repo with a `README` file.

Initialized NodeJS with `package.json`:
```
npm init 
```

Installed TypeScript and created a `tsconfig.json` file:
```
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
npx tsc --init
```

## Prisma
Installed Prisma:
``` 
npx prisma@latest init --db 
```

Following this command, Prisma created an initial `prisma/schema.prisma` file and a `.env` file 
with a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already set.

Installed Prisma VS Code Extension.


In `schema.prisma` I added `SQLite` as a provider for simplicity as per *Note* in assignment instructions:
```js
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")  //Automatically created and stored in .env
}
```
Also changed the `DATABASE_URL` path to reflect this:

```js
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

Created a Prisma Schema:
```js
model Task {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())       // Prisma's built-in UUID 
  title      String                             
  completed  Boolean  @default(false)            // Defaults to false
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())            // Auto-generated timestamp
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt                 // Auto-updates on every change
}
```

Created `.gitignore` file and added the following (omitting `.env` as it does not contain private
keys, only a link to a local file, otherwise I would have included it):
```
node_modules
.DS_Store
```

Added boilerplate code taken from `Prisma /docs` in `src/index.ts`to send queries with Prisma ORM:
```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { withAccelerate } from '@prisma/extension-accelerate'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())

async function main() {

  const task = await prisma.task.create({
    data: {
      id: "eqiofjeoqfjeioq",
      title: 'Save Planet',
      completed: false,
    },
  })
  console.log(task)
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Ran the commands below to test:
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
npx tsx src/index.ts   
```

## GraphQL & Apollo
As I was not familiar with Pothos I decided to first get GraphQL and Apollo working together.
Note: I have left the GraphQL files in `src/graphql` however they are currently unused.

Installed Apollo Server and GraphQL:
```
npm install @apollo/server graphql
```

Also installed Prisma Client in order to communicate with the database:
```
npm install prisma-client
@pothos/plugin-prisma 
```


Created a `src/server.ts` file and added code below to connect the Apollo Server:
```js
// APOLLO SERVER
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});

async function start() {
  const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
    listen: { port: 4000 }
  });
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
}

start();
```

Created `src/graphql/schema.ts` and `resolvers.ts` files with my first 
*query* which was to return a list of all tasks:

```js
// THE SCHEMA or typeDefs TO DEFINE THE SHAPE OF THE DATA
export const typeDefs = gql`
  type Task {
    id: String!
    title: String!
    completed: Boolean!
    createdAt: String!
    updatedAt: String!
  }
```

```js
// THE FUNCTION WHICH RETURNS A LIST OF ALL TASKS
// NOTE THAT I AM USING PRISMA-CLIENT TO FETCH THE DATA FROM THE DATABASE
import { PrismaClient } from '../generated/prisma';

export const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    tasks: async (_: any, args: { search?: string }) => {
      const { search } = args;
      return prisma.task.findMany({
        where: search
          ? {
              title: {
                contains: search
              }
            }
          : undefined,
        orderBy: {
          createdAt: 'desc'
        }
      });
    },
  }
}
```

I then added all other *Queries/Mutations* and tested them on the Apollo Server (browser):

![graphql ](./src/media/graphql.png "")


Once happy, I moved to migrating to Pothos.

## Pothos

Read documentation on Pothos to understand what the project structure should look like.

Installed Pothos:
```js
npm install --save @pothos/core 
```

Created `src/builder.ts` file to set up the schema builder:

```js
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypesFromClient<typeof prisma>;
  Context: { prisma: PrismaClient };
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: prisma,
  },
});
```

Created `src/schema/models/task.ts` to match the `prisma.schema` file:

```js
import { builder } from './builder';

builder.prismaObject('Task', {
  fields: (t: any) => ({
    id: t.exposeID('id'),
    title: t.exposeString('title'),
    completed: t.exposeBoolean('completed'),
    createdAt: t.expose('createdAt', { type: 'DateTime' }),
    updatedAt: t.expose('updatedAt', { type: 'DateTime' }),
  }),
});
```
Then created `src/schema/query.ts` file with my first resolver function to return a list
of all tasks:

```js
builder.queryType({
  fields: (t) => ({

    tasks: t.prismaField({
      type: ['Task'],
      args: {
        search: t.arg.string(),
      },
      resolve: (query, _parent, args, context) => {
        return context.prisma.task.findMany({
          where: args.search
            ? { title: { contains: args.search } }
            : undefined,
          orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
          ...query,
        });
      },
    }),
  }),
});
```

Ensured model definition, query and mutation files are imported in `src/server.ts`:

```js
import './schema/models/task'; //MODEL DEFINITION
import './schema/query' // FILE CONTAINING QUERIES
import './schema/mutation' // FILE CONTAINING MUTATIONS
```

As I had previously made all the **Queries and Mutations** on the Apollo Server with GraphQL, adding and testing each with Pothos was straight forward.

## GraphQL-Queries

Please see below the list of queries and mutations:
```gql
query getTasks {
  # Returns a list of all tasks
  tasks {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
query getTaskById {
  # Returns "null" if not found
  task (id: "05e76901-cb3a-4902-9260-f1d5e1bb4cfa") {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
query getTaskFiltered {
  # Include an optional search argument (search: String)
  # Returns a list of all tasks matching the string => "Go to the gym"
  tasks(search: "Go") {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
mutation addTask {
  # Creates a new task with the given title and assigns a unique ID
  # Sets "completed" to false by default
  # Returns the newly created task.
  addTask(title: "Go to the gym") {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
  }
}
mutation toggleTask {
  # "Go to the gym" is now set to "completed: true"
  # Updates the updatedAt timestamp
  # Returns the updated task or "null" if not found.
  toggleTask(
    id: "674da772-4aff-491f-a24b-ae78e716004d"
    title: "Go to the gym"
    completed: true
  ) {
    id
    title
    completed
    updatedAt
  }
}
mutation deleteTask{
  # Deletes a task by its ID.
  # Returns the deleted task or "null" if not found.
  deleteTask(id: "21abd6cc-597c-45f7-bfed-baab266da9fd") {
    title
    id
    completed
  }
}
```

Note: As GraphQL doesnâ€™t have a built-in DateTime scalar type TypeScript was throwing an error,
I had to install `graphql-scalars` and add these lines to the `builder.ts` file:

```js
export const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Scalars: {
    DateTime: {
      Input: Date;
      Output: Date;
    };
  };
  builder.addScalarType('DateTime', DateTimeResolver, {});
  ```

## Zod Validation

Installed Zod:
```js
npm install zod
```
### Adding validation to a Query or Mutation in 3 steps.

1. Created a file `src/validation/task.ts` and added the below code:

```js
import { z } from 'zod';

export const getTasksSchema = z.object({
  search: z
  .string()
  /* 
  In this example, Zod will validate the user input only
  if no special characters are used in the search
  */
  .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]*$/, "No special characters allowed")
  .optional()
});
```
2. Created a middleware to handle the error in `src/middleware/zodValidate.ts`:
```js
import { ZodSchema } from 'zod';

export function validateArgs<T>(schema: ZodSchema<T>, args: unknown): T {
  const result = schema.safeParse(args);
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(result.error.issues.map(i => i.message).join(', '));
  }
  return result.data;
}
```

3. Added the below code to the existing query *getTasks* in `src/schema/query.ts`:
```js
   resolve: async (query, _parent, args, context) => {
    /* 
    Validating input with Zod through a middleware
    In this case: "No special characters allowed" 
    */
        const validatedArgs = validateArgs(getTasksSchema, args);
        return context.prisma.task.findMany({
          where: validatedArgs.search
            ? { title: { contains: validatedArgs.search } }
            : undefined,
          orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
          ...query
        });
      }
```
Added other types of validation for each Query/Mutation and tested on Apollo Server.


## Bonus Points:
### *Discussing in your README how you would more complex error scenarios.*
I think that it is great that GraphQL and Apollo already have error handling built in as it is important to receive clear error messages
when building an application. It helps debugging quickly and efficiently and improves DX overall.
I found Zod to be really helpful as GraphQL/Apollo still had limitations with their errors.
This is crucial for developers but also users as it keeps the application user friendly and accessible on the frontend.
Ideally we would want each error to return a clear message, the location of the file and which line, and also a snipet of the code causing the issue.
Suggestions on how to fix the error ("did you mean this?" for example) is always welcome!

### *Add any additional queries or mutations you feel would enhance the project (no more than 2).*
Added `getTasksByDateRange` and `deleteTasks` with Zod validation. 
Resolver and GraphQL query for *deleteTasks* below:

```js
//DELETE MANY TASKS
builder.mutationField('deleteTasks', (t) =>
  t.prismaField({
    type: ['Task'],
    args: {
      ids: t.arg.stringList({ required: true })
    },
    resolve: async (query, _parent, args, context) => {
      const validatedArgs = validateArgs(deleteTasksSchema, args);
      const tasksToDelete = await context.prisma.task.findMany({
        where: { id: { in: args.ids } },
        ...query
      });

      if (!tasksToDelete) {
        throw new ApolloError(`Error, ids: ${args.ids} not found`, 'NOT_FOUND');
      }
      await context.prisma.task.deleteMany({
        where: { id: { in: args.ids } }
      });

      return tasksToDelete;
    }
  })
);
```
GraphQL Query:
```js
mutation deleteTasks{
  deleteTasks(ids: [
    "4bb92759-7bf0-49f6-bc6d-443ea56c6e9", "9c79fd1b-a81f-401f-8b53-81f0f7d2fcd",
    ]) {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

## Challenges
* Relationships between Prisma/Pothos/Apollo were challenging to grasp at first.
* Pothos was totally new and required some time to get used to.

## Wins
* Creating Prisma database 
* Connecting Apollo with GraphQL.
* Migrating was straight forward as when I encountered errors, I knew this was coming
from Pothos.

## Key Learning/Takeaways
* GraphQL Queries and Mutations.
* Creating the database with Prisma was enjoyable.
* Pothos was new but the documentation was very clear which helped a lot.
* Zod was also new and reminded me of Jest and so easier to handle.
